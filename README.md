# unity-server
Just an experiment for the moment, that allows a tcp socket connection between unity and node

I got this partially working before I lost interest. I'll leave it here incase anyone fancies making their own Unity socket server.

It contains the base app for allowing you to connect Unity to NodeJS, I tested it in Unity version 5.0.
